## Challenge Instructions

You're after a Flag which is stored as encrypted pieces of a puzzle in this repository.

To decrypt each piece and recover the Flag you'll need to look at the repository as well as its contributors.

The Flag will reveal itself only once you have _decrypted_ all pieces and _put them in the right order_.

You may want to look in non-trivial places.

### Gitxray to the rescue

If you get stuck, you may want to explore using [Gitxray](https://github.com/kulkansecurity/gitxray); it can certainly help.
